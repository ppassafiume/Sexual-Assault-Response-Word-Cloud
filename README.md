# Sexual-Assault-Response-Word-Cloud
I saw an article where a professor did a word cloud on sexual misconduct responses from celebrities accused. 
I thought it was interesting so I decided to make one real quick. I took responses from NY Times. 
Some I searched and took the whole response, while a few others I took the small quote they used on the site. 
I changed some words that are very similar. Note: My word cloud was done quickly and can be improved. 
Also, the word cloud simply shows the frequencies of words used. It doesn't analyze sentiment. 
This isn't a statement on sexual assault or responses in general, it's just a quick project I found interesting.
