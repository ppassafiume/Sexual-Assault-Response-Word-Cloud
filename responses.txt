I have always wanted our animation studios to be places where creators can explore their vision with the support and collaboration of other gifted animators and storytellers. This kind of creative culture takes constant vigilance to maintain. It’s built on trust and respect, and it becomes fragile if any members of the team don’t feel valued. As a leader, it’s my responsibility to ensure that doesn’t happen; and I now believe I have been falling short in this regard.

I’ve recently had a number of difficult conversations that have been very painful for me. It’s never easy to face your missteps, but it’s the only way to learn from them. As a result, I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor, advocate and champion I want to be. It’s been brought to my attention that I have made some of you feel disrespectful or uncomfortable. That was never my intent. Collectively, you mean the world to me, and I deeply apologize if I have let you down. I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form. No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.

In my conversations with Disney, we are united in our committed to always treat any concerns you have with the seriousness they deserve, and to address them in an appropriate manner. We also share a desire to reinforce the vibrant, respectful culture that has been the foundation of our studios’ success since the beginning. And we agreed the first step in that direction is for me to take some time away to reflect on how to move forward from here. As hard as it is for me to step away from a job I am so passionate about and a team I hold in the highest regard, not just as artists but as people, I know it’s the best thing for all of us right now. My hope is that a six-month sabbatical will give me the opportunity to start taking better care of myself, to recharge and be inspired, and ultimately return with the insight and perspective I need to be the leader you deserve.

I’m immensely proud of this team, and I know you will continue to wow the world in my absence. I wish you all a wonderful holiday season and look forward to working together again in the new year.

In my 45 years in journalism, I have prided myself on being an advocate for the careers of the women with whom I have worked,” Rose said in a statement to the Washington Post. “Nevertheless, in the past few days, claims have been made about my behavior toward some former female colleagues. In my 45 years in journalism, I have prided myself on being an advocate for the careers of the women with whom I have worked,” Rose said in a statement to the Washington Post. “Nevertheless, in the past few days, claims have been made about my behavior toward some former female colleagues. I have learned a great deal as a result of these events, and I hope others will too. All of us, including me, are coming to a newer and deeper recognition of the pain caused by conduct in the past, and have come to a profound new respect for women and their lives.

I apologize to any women who felt uncomfortable in my presence, and for any situation where I behaved inappropriate. Any behavior that makes a women feel disrespectful or uncomfortable is unacceptable

The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women. There's more I want to say, but the first and most important thing—and if it's the only thing you care to hear, that's fine—is: I'm sorry.
"I respect women. I don't respect men who don't. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.
"But I want to say something else, too. Over the last few months, all of us—including and especially men who respect women—have been forced to take a good, hard look at our own actions and think (perhaps, shamefully, for the first time) about how those actions have affected women.
"For instance, that picture. I don't know what was in my head when I took that picture, and it doesn't matter. There's no excuse. I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn't funny. It's completely inappropriate. It's obvious how Leeann would feel violated by that picture. And, what's more, I can see how millions of other women would feel violated by it—women who have had similar experiences in their own lives, women who fear having those experiences, women who look up to me, women who have counted on me.
"Coming from the world of comedy, I've told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive. But the intentions behind my actions aren't the point at all. It's the impact these jokes had on others that matters. And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to come to terms with that.
"While I don't remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women experiences.
"I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate.
"And the truth is, what people think of me in light of this is far less important than what people think of women who continue to come forward to tell their stories. They deserve to be heard, and believed. And they deserve to know that I am their ally and supporter. I have let them down and am committed to making it up to them."

How does one respond to accusationss so serious that being innocent is not a good enough defense?

It is excruciating to learn just how quickly, in one news cycle, people conclude that because I have left DFJ there must be some credence to vicious and wholly false allegations about sexual predation and workplace harassment. Let me be perfectly clear: no such allegations are true.

The headlines, so far, arise from the juxtaposition of events, and the wrongful assumption that my departure must be due to a conclusory finding from the ongoing DFJ investigation, which began not with a complaint, but with unsubstantiated rumors.

I left DFJ because of interpersonal dynamics with my partners. The three-month investigation, that has yet to conclude (and I welcome the results whenever that takes place), broke down a normal team dynamic into factions that isolate communications and defer to the advice of lawyers. Add a modicum of stress (such as implied allegations in the press) and deadlines (our annual LP meeting is today), and people show a different side of their personality. I did. So did my partners. It’s incredibly sad to see how things broke down, and the acrimony that arose between us.

I have learned a great deal from this experience. I have seen how my communication style can be hurtful in times of stress. This has affected my relationship with my partners and in my personal life. I have learned that a personal relationship (one that doesn't involve employees, or prospective employees, or others in the workplace) is not so personal or private after all. I have also learned that an ill-advised relationship, where the other person is left feeling hurt, anger or scorned, can have far reaching consequences in the digital age. It is inaccurate and unfair to describe any of this as harassment or predation.

I think my personal life, and other people’s personal lives, should stay personal. It should not be in the court of public opinion. This is the last I will say on this subject for the foreseeable future.

I am incredibly appreciate of the outpouring of support from people who know me, and most especially from my family. Thank you so much.

I am excited to move on and get back to my professional passion, helping great entrepreneurs forge the future.

I have made comments on women appearances and clothes in my capacity as an executive producer, but they were not sexualized. Like many people, I have given someone a non-sexual hug or kiss on the cheek. I have proudly mentored both male and female colleagues for many years. But never in what I believe to be an unwanted way and certainly never in a sexual way,I want to address the stories told to the New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not.

These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a women my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admire me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.

I have been remorse of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I’m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admire me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position.

I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admire in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn’t want to hear it. I didn’t think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it.

There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with.

I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admire their work.

The hardest regret to live with is what you’ve done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I’d be remiss to exclude the hurt that I’ve brought on people who I work with and have worked with who’s professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I’ve brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years.

I’ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.

I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen.

Launching start-up news websites definitely led to conflicts with a few employees, but I never intentionally acted in an inappropriate manner nor spoke to or touched a colleague in a sexually inappropriate way. To the extent my behavior was perceived as disrespectful, I deeply and sincerely apologize and will ensure it does not happen again.

These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign.

I am aware that a former disgruntled assistant of mine has made a private post implying that I had acted in an improper manner toward her. I adamantly and vehemently reject and deny any and all implication and allegation that I have ever engaged in any improper behavior toward this person or any other person I have ever worked with. I am appalled and distressed by this baseless allegation. 

It is disheartening and sad to me that as a result of two unverified and provably untrue social media claims, there are some in this environment who could ever conclude I have had anything to do with such vile and horrific conduct. I absolutely have not, and I am cooperate with the authorities so that they can clear my name as soon as possible. I do not know this women. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any women. I certainly have never committed rape

Mr. Guillod denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex

To say that the past few weeks, and especially the past four days, have been trying and difficult would be an understatement. With prayer, support from my family and friends, and hundreds of people, we have endured. I want to thank so many Kentuckians who have reached out to me and my family during this time The decision today is what is best for Kentucky, what is best for the House of Representatives. For 21 years, the folks in Russell, Clinton, Cumberland, and Pulaski counties have given me the honor and privilege to serve and represent them here in Frankfort. I have served them and the citizens of this state to the very best of my ability. I have tried to develop and maintain a sense of fairness, honesty, and integrity in all my dealings and actions in Frankfort. I have tried, since January, as Speaker of the House, to change the tone of how things were done in Frankfort, to show that folks from both parties, majority and minority, should be engaged in the process and could work together to solve issues and make the Kentucky we all love a better place. I am proud of the work we have done, and the progress we have made. Now we face a difficult time . . .

A few weeks ago, on October 17th, I received a letter from an attorney on behalf of his client making allegations, let me repeat, allegations, against me and others for sexual harassment. The letter was not a demand letter in the sense of demanding a sum of money – it requested that we negotiate a resolution instead of litigating the allegations. I immediately contacted and sought the advice of counsel. After discussing the matter with counsel on October 18th, I informed the other individuals named in the allegations. On October 20th, we met with counsel to discuss the allegations. In the meantime, our counsel and the complainant’s attorney spoke about setting up a formal mediation with a mediator selected, and paid, by both sides in an effort to resolve the dispute and in a manner requested by the complainant’s attorney. By mutual agreedment, this meeting was held five days later, just eight days after the letter was received, and as was requested by the complainant. At that mediation, an agreedment was reached between all parties and all counsel to resolve the issue. None of the parties against whom the allegations were made admitted any wrongdoing. In fact, all of those individuals, including myself, absolutely and expressly deny any sexual harassment had taken place. The parties agreedd that the mediation and resolution should remain confidential, which was important to both sides in the effort to move forward in the employment relationship. I did make mistakes in that I engaged in inappropriate text messages. I engaged in banter that was consensual, but yet was wrong on my part, and, for that, I am truly support. I have asked for and received forgive from God, my wife, Karyn, and my family has forgiven me and I have their unwavering support. Today, I ask the people of this Commonwealth to forgive me for my actions. I am truly sorry and ask for your forgive. But, as inappropriate as those text messages were, I want to reiterate at no time did I engage in unwelcome or unwanted conduct of any kind, and at no time were there ever any sexual relations of any kind. There has never been a culture of sexual harassment, as some opportunists would wrongly claim for their personal political gain.

I can move forward in my life thanks to friends and family who, I hope, know the real Jeff Hoover, and know this was a mistake. I have fallen short. I am a sinner. My Twitter bio says “sinner saved by God’s grace.” That is me, even though some media reports have made light of my faith and this statement in their reporting. However, we are at a point that this is more than being about Jeff Hoover.

We have many issues facing this state, not the least of which is the pension crisis. During the past few weeks, I have spoken out when I disagreedd with the rhetoric and condescending attitude coming from some. I spoke out in support of my wife and teachers across this state when they were unfairly accused of “hoarding sick days. I spoke out and said those comments were disappoint. For that, I was chastised and told that was never said, although I had the audio and had listened to it and gotten the full story to confirm what was said before I made any public comment. I spoke out a few weeks ago when comments were made to a Louisville radio station about the pension discussion, comments which breached confidential discussion. When I objected, I was told I was “disrespectful and my objections were insulting.” There are other examples, but it is fair to say I am not the favorite legislator of some in this Capitol, nor have I ever been, quite honestly.

The decision I have to make is what is best for the state at this time; what is best for this House of Representatives; what is best for my caucus members who stood strong with me and gave me their overwhelming support on Friday. It is no longer about Jeff Hoover. Today, it is more important than Jeff Hoover.

In light of what has been said and transpired in the past day or so, there is no question that moving forward in the 2018 session will be difficult. I have been convicted of sexual harassment by some without knowing all the facts, without an opportunity to even defense against “allegations,” and convicted by some without any grasp or understanding or appreciate for the law.

As we move toward the 2018 session, I do not want the story to always be about me versus someone else. I am not afraid of that battle, but it is how it will be portrayed. That is not fair to the people of this state, nor is it fair to my caucus members. It is not fair to the process that I have worked so hard to improve. And that is not conducive to getting problem solved and addressing issues facing us.

Therefore, I am announcing my resignation as Speaker of the House, effective immediately. I will continue to serve as State Representative for the people of the 83rd District and represent them to the very best of my ability. I will continue to work hard to solve problem facing this state, and speak out when necessary.

I leave the position of Speaker with no animosity toward anyone, not even those who have been working and conspiring for months for this result, nor those who have used this as an opportunity for political gain. My actions today is because I love the Commonwealth of Kentucky and its people. I appreciate all those who have offered support and prayers. I am blessed. We are confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims,” read a statement from an attorney of Mr. Ratner, who is suing his rape accuser for libel.
Mr. Webster has had multiple relationships over the course of his professional life, all of which have been consensual,
I am deeply sorry to the people I hurt. My behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and I accept full responsibility.” He said he was grateful to his colleagues “for every minute I’ve had to work with each of you. .?.?. Public radio matters so much and I will always be your supporter
As I understand it, some employees, to my deep dismay, complained this week that my presence had led them to feel uncomfortable at The New Republic. Women have longstanding and profound concerns with respect to their treatment in the workplace. Many men have a lot to learn in this regard. I know I do, and I hope for and encourage that new direction

I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I'm beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apologize for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.

"This story has encourage me to address other things about my life. I know that there are stories out there about me and that some have been fuelled by the fact that I have been so protective of my privacy. As those closest to me know, in my life I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man. I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behavior. 

I am very disturbed by these anonymous allegations, which make my heart ache. I take them very seriously.”

“I am profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused by my past actions. I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated.”
We are heartbroken and confounded by deliberate and cruel defamations,
“I fully recognize that I have tested certain boundaries, which I am working hard to correct.”
“For my offenses against some of my colleagues in the past I offer a shaken apologize and ask for their forgive.”
“Many of his professional interactions with subjects were sexual and explicit in nature but all of the subjects of his work participated consensually,
I alone am entirely responsible for my moral failings. This is not the way the head of a company like ours should have acted.”
Each of the women who have come forward used grains of truth to sell false narrative.”
I am deeply sorry and I am ashamed.
Mr. Signore unequivocally denies allegations of sexual assault, harassment or retaliation of any kind,
I came of age in the ‘60s and ‘70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then.

I have since learned it’s not an excuse, in the office — or out of it. To anyone.

I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person, and my interactions with the people I work with have change.

I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.

Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go. That is my committed. My journey now will be to learn about myself and conquer my demons. Over the last year, I’ve asked Lisa Bloom to tutor me, and she’s put together a team of people. I’ve brought on therapists, and I plan to take a leave of absence from my company and to deal with this issue head on. I so respect all women, and regret what happened.


I hope that my actions will speak louder than words and that one day we will all be able to earn their trust and sit down together with Lisa to learn more. Jay Z wrote in 4:44: “I’m not the man I thought I was, and I better be that man for my children.” The same is true for me. I want a second chance in the community, but I know I’ve got work to do to earn it. I have goals that are now priorities. Trust me, this isn’t an overnight process. I’ve been trying to do this for 10 years, and this is a wake-up call. I cannot be more remorse about the people I hurt, and I plan to do right by all of them.

I am going to need a place to channel that anger, so I’ve decided that I’m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party. I’m going to do it at the same place I had my Bar Mitzvah. I’m making a movie about our President, perhaps we can make it a joint retirement party. One year ago, I began organizing a $5 million foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC. While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year. It will be named after my mom, and I won’t disappoint her.
